# Assemble-Game

## Overview
This project is an assembly language game designed to run with a specific bitmap display configuration. It's a fascinating exploration into low-level programming and graphics handling directly with assembly instructions.

## Configuration
The game is configured to use a bitmap display with the following settings:

- **Unit Width in Pixels:** 4
- **Unit Height in Pixels:** 4
- **Display Width in Pixels:** 256
- **Display Height in Pixels:** 256
- **Base Address for Display:** 0x10008000 ($gp)

These settings can be updated as needed to match different display requirements or to experiment with different resolutions.

## Milestones
The game development process includes several milestones. While the details of these milestones are described in the project assignment handout, here's a placeholder section where you can outline which milestones have been achieved in this submission.

## Getting Started
To get started with this game, you will need an MIPS assembly environment set up that supports bitmap display. Here's a basic guide on how to run the game:

1. Ensure your MIPS environment is correctly configured according to the bitmap display settings.
2. Load the `game.asm` file into your MIPS simulator.
3. Compile and run the game, following your environment-specific procedures.
